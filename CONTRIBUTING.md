### Making a clean pull request

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

- Create a personal fork of the project on your Github.
- Clone the forked project on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called `origin`.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch out from `master`.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Write or adapt tests as needed.
- Update the README.md with details/updates of changes to the existing/new functionalities.
- Push your branch to your fork on Github, the remote `origin`.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's `master` branch.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged you can pull the changes from `upstream` to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

And last but not least: Always write your commit messages in the present tense. Your commit message should describe what the commit, when applied, does to the code â€“ not what you did to the code.
